// //TEST
// console.log(add(4,3)) //should print 7
// console.log(add(100,42)) //should print 142

/**
 * For the above function, what happens if you give only one input? What happens if you give more than the specified number of inputs?
 */

//console.log(add(100)); //What happens? it returns undefined..
//console.log(add(1,4,5));//What happens? I guess that three argument is ignored.So return value 5.

/**
 * 3.What do you think gets printed when you run the following code? Try to predict what happens and then see if you can figure out why. The extra sentence that we are printing out in the two console.log statements at the end will help you figure out what is happening where. Scroll to the explanation below to find the answer.
