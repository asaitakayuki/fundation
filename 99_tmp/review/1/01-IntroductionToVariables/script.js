//3.Compute some basic geometry. You may need to use Google to remember the formulas.



//// Compute and store the area of a square

//// Compute and store the area of a rectangle
//const rectangleBaseLength = 3;
//const rectangleHeightLength = 4;
//// Your code here.
//
//let rectangleArea = rectangleBaseLength * rectangleHeightLength;
//
//console.log(rectangleArea); // should print "12"
//
//// Compute and store the area of a triangle
//const triangleBaseLength = 4;
//const triangleHeightLength = 5;
//// Your code here.
//
//let triangleArea = ( triangleBaseLength * triangleHeightLength) / 2;
//
//console.log(triangleArea); // should print "10"
